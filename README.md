# Basic Commands

This repository is for personal use and contains a collection of day-to-day commands that I use frequently. These commands serve as a reference for common tasks and utilities.

I will be slowly updating this repo with more commands as I encounter them. The repository will only contain README files with explanations of these commands, not scripts.

Feel free to browse through and use any of the commands listed.

## Contents
- System commands
- Network commands
- File management commands
- Other utilities

Stay tuned for updates!
